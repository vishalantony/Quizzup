This is a Quizzing app created by me. Users can sign up and post questions and take quizzes.
The questions of a quiz are generated completely randomly and it is taken only by the user who
clicks on the 'take a quiz' button.

This project is still under development.


The following list, gives the basic rails commands to help you around.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server


Thank you.
